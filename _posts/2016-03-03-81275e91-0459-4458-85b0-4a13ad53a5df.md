# Dahabiya Nile cruise:

A journey on the legendary river on board of a small houseboat offers the romance of the past. Sailing on such boats, known as Dahabiyas, was a popular way to travel and relax,sailing through the lovely scenery and the ruins of famous temples all the way round.That was how 19th-century travellers going up and down the Nile experienced life on board. Follow in their footsteps and sail the Nile by Dahabiya.

### The Rais:

Every Dayabiya journey takes you not only to the well-known highlights on the banks of the river Nile, but also to lesser known sites only visited by the favoured few.   
With the wind flapping at their long galabeyas, the Rais (skipper), and his crew will ensure you want for nothing.

This exclusive, relaxing way of travelling is for those who want the best. We can now invite travellers to recapture the elegant days of the past. **Come aboard and enjoy!**
