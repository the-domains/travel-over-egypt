# Queen Nefertari:

Nefertari was Ramses II's wife for over 24 years. What was probably a politically inspired union would, over time, blossom into an **amorous relationship** wherein Ramses II celebrated his love for her with monuments and poetry dedicated to her honor. The many titles ascribed to her attest to the esteem Ramses held for her and the various roles she undertook in her function as queen. Designations such as _Sweet of Love_, _Bride of God_ and _Lady of the Two Lands_, demonstrate her positions as lover, priestess and political functionary. She is known to have even accompanied Ramses, in some cases, on military campaigns.

Egyptologists have found **statues and images** of Nefertari throughout Egypt. At Luxor, statues of the queen are at the foot of giant statues of Ramses II. Other images show her leading the royal children in rituals or during festivals. Images also show Nefertari with her husband honoring the gods or commemorating events.

Scholars have found more evidence of Queen Nefertari's importance in the capital city of the **Hittites**. Early in his reign, Ramses II was at war with the Hittites but a peace treaty was established during his reign. After they made peace, Nefertari wrote letters to the king and queen of the Hittites. She also sent gifts to the queen, including a gold necklace.

Ramses II built a beautiful tomb for his wife in the Valley of the Queens near [Thebes][0]. It is now known as QV66 and is the largest and **most beautiful tomb** in the valley. Thieves stole all the queen's grave goods in antiquity, including her sarcophagus and her mummy. Egyptologists only found fragments of Nefertari's body and a few grave goods in the tomb.

Nefertari's tomb is known for the beautiful and well preserved wall paintings. Some of them depict the **crown** of Queen Nefertari. Often, she wears a crown associated with different goddesses like [Isis][1] or [Hathor][2]. In her tomb, the wall paintings show the queen honoring the gods and goddesses who would help her on her journey in the afterlife.

The ceiling of the tomb is blue and has stars painted over the ceiling. Most of the wall paintings were well preserved and Egyptologists have worked to restore and protect them. Today, The Egyptian government controls and **limits** visitors to the cave. Hieroglyphics cover the walls and many are passages from the [Book of the Dead][3]. Most of the images are pictorial depictions of several chapters from the Book of the Dead.

Queen Nefertari's tomb represents a **key cultural image** for two reasons. The first is that the tomb's preservation gives scholars a glimpse of the beauty and color that was a part of most royal tombs. Second, it demonstrates the building expertise of artisans during Ramses II's reign. Some saw scholars regard her tomb as one of the greatest of the many works completed during his reign.
